# DoctorBot

Welcome to DoctorBot, your personal health assistant powered by machine learning!

## About
DoctorBot is an innovative project created by Aditya Khamitkar in collaboration with Intel and the Government of India, specifically the National e-Governance Division (NEGD) under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, as part of the Intel AI4Youth program. The aim of DoctorBot is to leverage machine learning (ML) techniques to detect and provide insights on various health conditions including Alzheimer's disease, heart diseases, diabetes, epilepsy, and more. Our ultimate goal is to create a Language Learning Model (LLM) that users can interact with to discuss their health concerns. DoctorBot will analyze symptoms, provide probable causes of the condition, and even suggest medications, all free of cost.

## Disease Prediction
- **Alzheimer's Disease**: Utilizes cognitive assessment data and neuroimaging techniques to detect early signs of Alzheimer's.
- **Heart Diseases**: Analyzes various health parameters such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and heart rate to assess the risk of heart diseases.
- **Diabetes**: Uses retinal images to detect diabetic retinopathy, a common complication of diabetes.
- **Epilepsy**: Analyzes EEG (Electroencephalogram) data to detect abnormal brain activity associated with epilepsy.
